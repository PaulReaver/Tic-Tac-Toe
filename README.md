# Tic-Tac-Toe
A good old 2-player game of Tic-Tac-Toe. This was created as part of The Odin Project curriculum

## Motivation
This project was created to:
- Train myself in the process of building solutions to existing mechanics such as these of a Tic-Tac-Toe game.
- Practice in creating designs that convey a particular feel. In this case, playing the game on an old school blackboard.

## Quick Start
Publicly available at the following link: https://paulreaver.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe/

## Usage
- **Player 1 starts:** They click on an empty cell on the game board.
- **Player 2 follows:** After Player 1's move, Player 2 gets to click on an empty cell.

Players take turns until the game is finished. Each one has the option to change their name by clicking on the editable label above the game board.
